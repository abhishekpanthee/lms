# Learning Management System

This mini-project is prepared with basic knowledge of a high-level programming language(C).
Thus, it incorporates the use of pure English syntaxes of function that are predefined in C library.
This program will require an account which is of three roles (Administrator, Teacher and a Student)
by entering his/her details which varies according to the roles for eg the administrator will have to
just enter id name and password but for teacher subject and number fields are added and for the
student faculty is added in place of subject and then the unique password that will be stored in
database. The person can then login into the system and then use the features associated with their
roles.
